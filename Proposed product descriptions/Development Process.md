# KBase Development Process: Testing improvements

## Summary

An initial implementation of basic end-to-end testing for at least one
repository in the project, to start establishing best practices on this front.

## Story/Description

KBase is in serious need of improved testing practices across the project.
This single-sprint effort aims to start paying some fo that technical debt by
showing how to implement automated testing at multiple levels for at least one
repository in the project.

Improved testing practices, once adopted project-wide, will have a significant
impact in improving code quality and reducing the re-appearance of
previously-fixed bugs.  This is a long-overdue, most basic of improvements to
the software engineering standards of the project, so while "now" is already
*late*, late is better than never.



## User stories

* Users will be able to go to any of the project's repositories and find the
  testing coverage for that repo, the results of the latest build, and tests
  associated with any previously reported and fixed bugs.

* When making new contributions to the project, users and developers will be
  able to see their pull requests immediately tested even before the code is
  reviewed.  The review process than thus proceed with higher confidence that
  the code in question doesn't break any existing functionality.

- Unit tests implemented.
- Code coverage added

## Timeline

While this is an area where the project should, over time, do a lot more work,
for now this is being deliberately scoped to a single sprint.  In the face of
many other competing priorities, at least spending *one* sprint building better
testing will help the project start adopting these practices as part of the
regular development process.

## Test plan

By definition, this PD is specifically about testing, so this is covered above.
